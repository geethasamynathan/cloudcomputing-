Cloud computing is a way to get IT services like computing power, storage, and databases over the internet, paying only for what you use. Instead of buying and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access these services from various providers. To start learning cloud computing, you can choose from popular providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Oracle Cloud.
